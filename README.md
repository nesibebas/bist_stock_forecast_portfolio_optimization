# 📈 Forecast-Based Portfolio Optimization Using Time Series and Volatility Modeling

This project is an academic term project prepared within the scope of the **Gebze Technical University (GTU) IE 310 Forecasting Methods and Applications** course.

This project provides scientific and data-driven guidance to investors by in-depth analyzing the historical performance of Borsa Istanbul (BIST) stocks and developing **forecast-based portfolio management strategies**.

---

## Project Purpose

To create and forecast a portfolio of three Borsa Istanbul (BIST) stocks Turkish Airlines, Akbank, and Arçelik using time series modeling (ARIMA) and volatility modeling (GARCH).

### 🧩 Project Phases:

1.  **Historical Return Analysis:** Analyzing daily returns, volatility, and correlation between selected stocks.
2.  **90-Day Forecast Modeling:** Applying Time Series models (ARIMA) to predict future price movements.
3.  **Optimum Portfolio Management:** Constructing and simulating a portfolio based on forecasted prices.
   
### Steps:

* Data preprocessing and daily return calculation

* Stationarity testing with ADF test

* Model selection using Auto ARIMA (AIC/BIC)

* 90-day forecast generation for each stock

* Volatility analysis using GARCH(1,1)

* Diagnostic analysis of residuals (Ljung-Box, QQ Plot, Histogram)

* Portfolio value forecasting and comparison with actual values

## 💼 Portfolio & Methodology

### Portfolio Details
A 1,000,000 TL initial investment portfolio was constructed using shares from three major and representative companies listed on Borsa Istanbul:

* **Turkish Airlines (THYAO)**
* **Akbank (AKBNK)**
* **Arçelik (ARCLK)**

### ⚙️ Methodology

**Data Source:** Yahoo Finance (daily closing prices of THYAO, AKBNK, ARCLK, BIST100)

### 🛠️ Tools & Models Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, arch, pmdarima, seaborn, yfinance
* **Modeling:** ARIMA, GARCH
* **Optimization:** Portfolio simulation based on forecasted returns.

## 📉 Results and Discussion (Forecast & Performance)

### Initial Forecast Performance

* **Short-Run Success:** The 90-day price forecasts generated by the **ARIMA** model revealed good accuracy **in the short run (until mid-January)**.
  
* **Medium/Long-Run Failure:** The model's predictive capability **significantly failed in the medium and long run** (especially after March), proving incapable of predicting sudden, sharp price changes.Therefore, the importance of GARCH analysis is shown.
  
* **Observations:**  
  * THYAO and ARCLK displayed higher volatility, while AKBNK showed stability.

  * ARIMA models tended to overestimate future returns (trend continuation bias).

  * Combining ARIMA + GARCH gives more realistic forecasts by accounting for volatility persistence.

  * The actual portfolio value fell by about 15% after three months, revealing model optimism.

### Portfolio Simulation Result

* **Initial Scenario:** The simulated portfolio value largely coincided with the forecast initially.
* **Final Scenario:** Deviations began in mid-February, and the portfolio value started to decline significantly in April. By the end of May, the portfolio value had **decreased by approximately 15% to TL 850,000.**

### Key Metrics:

* **R² (Stock vs BIST100):** THYAO 0.56 | AKBNK 0.50 | ARCLK 0.45

* **Volatility Persistence (α + β):** THYAO 0.88 | AKBNK 0.90 | ARCLK ≈ 0.87

* **Forecast Trends:** THYAO ↓ | AKBNK ↑ | ARCLK ↑

## 💡 Analytical Implications and Future Work

These results provide a critical insight: financial time series are highly sensitive not only to the underlying trend but also to volatility and exogenous shocks.

### Methodological Development Proposal:

* **Combined Modeling:** For future studies, it is proposed that combining established time-series methods like ARIMA with **volatility-oriented models, such as GARCH**, will yield more robust and reliable forecasting results, better capturing market risk.
